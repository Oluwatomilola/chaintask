# ChainTask

ChainTask is a decentralized task management and collaboration platform built on Base, designed to make teamwork transparent, trustless, and rewarding. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure accountability, immutable task records, and on-chain incentives for contributors.

## Overview

Traditional task management tools rely on centralized systems that lack transparency and verifiability. ChainTask addresses this by moving task creation, assignment, and completion verification on-chain, enabling teams and communities to collaborate without intermediaries.

ChainTask is suitable for:

Remote teams and DAOs

Open-source contributor coordination

Web3 project management

Trust-minimized freelance collaboration
